        <span>After going through some interesting direct and indirect pathways in the field of computer science,  my work encapsulates the following programming languages: </span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <strong>Python</strong>
                    <dd>Having started my program of Computer Science, it only made logical sense to start programming in Python due to its visually easy to read syntax. The entity that provided my understanding and improved my existing interest in computers and programming in Python was the 'Turtle' module.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <strong>Java</strong>
                    <dd>One of the vastly used object-oriented programming language. An extremely useful programming language for modularity and further familiarity with complex computer science concepts and programming languages. Worked in group to make a knock-off version of ‘Angry Birds’.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <strong>ARMv8 Assembly</strong>
                    <dd>The low-level programming language used to manipulate computing hardware. ‘Computing Machinery I’ appeared to be a dry course but when it came to ‘Computing Machinery II’ everything connected and created so much more interest.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <strong>C Language</strong>
                    <dd>A much better understanding registers and memory was established. Utilizing that knowledge, as part of components, created the following in C language:<br><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>LED patterned lighting while using ExplorerHat (an add-on for Raspberry Pi).</li><br>
                            <li>SNES Controller driver in bare metal programming environment to be run on Raspberry Pi and developed in C</li>
                        </ol>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl><strong>C#</strong>
                    <dd>A much-advanced programming language compared to the previously mentioned. At least it appeared that way as it appeared to be more accessible and less or runtime and compilation errors. Developed an interface for Calgary Transit which took a different approach from the conventional paper ticketing system and additionally provided more flexibility to ticket validity and reload options. This was done as part of group project for ‘Human-Computer Interaction I’.</dd>

            <li>
                <dl><strong>JavaScript</strong>
                    <dd>Its very lovable. Just that I need more practice with getting along with it. Maybe I’m trying to aim for things far too away which brings discouragement. I’ll find my way through.</dd>
